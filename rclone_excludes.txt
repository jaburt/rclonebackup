### Notes ###
# rclone exclude rule file, used with the "rclonebackup.sh" script. All files and
# directories listed here will be excluded by the above script when rclone is executed.
# This means these files will not be backed-up via rclone to your cloudsync provider.
# 
# Please note that all directories you wish to sync/cryptcheck are sub-directories of the 
# "src" User Defined Variable in the above script.  So if you are using "/mnt/tank" as src
# the iocage folder would be located "/mnt/tank/iocage".
